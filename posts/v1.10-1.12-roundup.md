  Catch up on the three rapid releases that reshape Subspace Builder with a tag hub, refreshed navigation, and a data-driven projects page.

I blinked and three releases landed. Between tags, navigation, and a polished projects spotlight, the Subspace Builder has quietly turned into a sharper storytelling tool. Here is the tour through v1.10.0 to v1.12.0 and why they matter.

## Tags That Actually Help Readers (v1.10.0)

Discovery finally feels intentional thanks to a new `/tags/` hub that lists every topic, plus individual tag landing pages. Tag chips now surface on post listings so readers can keep exploring related content without hunting.

Behind the scenes, the post-share tracker CLI is rebuilt into a multi-step flow with channel summaries, filters, and clearer status states. Fresh documentation and a Vitest suite keep the tracker honest when it is time to hit publish.

## Navigation You Do Not Need to Fight (v1.11.0)

The shell of the site gets the spotlight next. The bulky sidebar is gone, replaced by a streamlined menu that keeps navigation tidy on every screen size. Page templates migrate into `src/`, shared data moves into YAML, and URL matching finally understands what is active.

That cleanup opened space to revisit the About page with clearer copy and richer structure. A Mastodon `rel=me` link rounds out the release so verified profiles show up without extra wiring.

## Projects That Tell Their Own Story (v1.12.0)

With tags and navigation locked in, v1.12.0 brings a fully fledged Projects page to the front of the site. Each card is powered by `_data/projects.yaml`, so updates happen in one place and roll out everywhere. Tag-based filters stay in sync with the results they control, and the visuals are tidied for readability.

The biggest win is flexibility: highlighting new work now becomes a content update instead of a redesign. Expect the Projects page to evolve more often now that it is data-driven.

## What Is Next

The groundwork is set for easier navigation around the blog site, with the new tags page, better navigation menu, and projects page.
